# Payvis
An app that allows you to keep track of how much you earned working if you work on a hourly basis. 
It shows you how long you worked, how much you have earned, and saves your data to a json file that
you can export and review later on.

# Features

- Keep track of how much you earned in a day and look into overall earnings data with the data export
button.

- Start the clock and forget about it until you are done working. Payvis is tolerant to closing the app
or turning your device off, so your data is protected from unwanted loss.

- Undo accidental clock-ins with the reset button. If you accidentally pressed "Start / Stop Count" on a day 
where you weren't working, you can press the reset button four times to clear your day's working data. If you
want to get rid of all your working data, you can press the reset button twenty-one times to purge all of your
data.
